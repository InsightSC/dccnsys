Dear {{ first_name }} {{ last_name }},

your submission #{{ submission.pk }} "{{ submission.title }}" for DCCN'2019 is now under the review.

The review ends at {{ deadline }}.

Please note, that until the end of review you are not allowed to change your manuscript or submission details.
If you have a strong reason to update your submission data, please contact organization committee.

However, you still can change your co-authors inside the system - since the review is double-blinded, the reviewers do not see them anyway.

Happy conferencing,
DCCN Organization Committee
